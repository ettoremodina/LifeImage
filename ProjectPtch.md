## **Project Proposal: Life Engine Optimization for Image Formation**

This project explores the intersection of artificial life, evolutionary algorithms, and pattern formation.

We will develop a **Life Engine** simulation where simple digital organisms live, move, interact, and reproduce on a 2D grid.

Their collective challenge: **evolve behaviors and strategies to arrange themselves into a target image** — without ever directly “seeing” the image.

The novelty lies in **how** we guide them toward the target.

Instead of a simple per-pixel reward function, we will experiment with **subtle evolutionary pressures** that balance local survival with a global objective.

The organisms’ “brains” will be small neural networks evolved over time, and the system will allow for both direct competition and indirect environmental shaping.

The outcome is not just to form an image, but to study how **different selective pressures** and **evolutionary designs** affect the emergence of large-scale patterns from local interactions.

### **Core Simulation Features**

- **Discrete 2D grid world** with regenerating resources and optional environmental heterogeneity.
- **Digital organisms** with energy, movement, local sensing, and reproduction.
- **Evolving neural network “brains”** controlling actions based on sensory inputs.
- **Multiple evolutionary pressures** possible, from colony competition to environmental feedback.
- **Target image approximation** as a subtle, emergent property rather than an explicit per-individual goal.

### **Possible Ways to Guide Image Formation**

1. **Multi-Level Selection**
    
    Colonies compete: after a set number of steps, the group whose layout best matches the image survives and seeds the next generation.
    
2. **Cascading Environmental Feedback**
    
    The world dynamically reacts: as the arrangement approaches the target, conditions improve (more resources, fewer threats); as it diverges, conditions worsen.
    
    1. **Indirect Spatial Pressure**
        
        Environmental cues (e.g., food distribution, temperature gradients) are subtly biased according to the target image, without organisms ever “seeing” the image directly.
        
3. **Developmental Program Replay**
    
    Instead of selecting on the final arrangement, evolve step-by-step growth programs that naturally unfold into the desired pattern.
    
4. **Coevolution**
    
    Multiple evolving populations influence each other’s success, pushing each to adapt strategies that may align with image formation.
    
5. **Adversarial Mimicry**
    
    Introduce an opposing population whose sole purpose is to disrupt the pattern, creating an arms race that drives robustness in image formation.
